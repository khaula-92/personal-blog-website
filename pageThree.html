        <p class="text">Zimbabwe is a great destination to visit all year round. Each season in Zimbabwe
             has something unique to offer with year-round game-viewing possibilities, a diverse range
              of wildlife, and a small fraction of the crowds that other parks in Africa see. </p>
            
             <h3 class="title"> DRY SEASON: MAY TO EARLY-NOVEMBER</h3>

             <p class="text"> For peak wildl./images/post3/nyamatusi_026.webpife viewing, Zimbabwe’s dry season from May to early November is 
                often described as the best time to go. As the ground water from the green season dissipate, 
                the land dries up offering fewer water sources. This results in spectacular game-viewing as
                 giraffe, elephant, zebra, buffalo, able, and other wildlife congregate in large numbers around
                  the watering holes. Our look-up blinds are strategically placed next to waterholes that are
                   frequented by large herds of elephants and other wildlife offering toenail and snout level
                    photography opportunities. The dry season also brings a dustier landscape with less grass
                     and foliage – better for unobstructed wildlife viewing.

                The temperatures during this season are warm and pleasant during the day, with cooler mornings
                 and evenings. May through August tends to be a bit cooler (night temperatures can drop into the
                  low 40s). In September and October the temperatures rise. These are also the driest months are 
                  considered the best time to see large elephant herds as they migrate in search of water sources.
                   In mid-late November, the rains begin, signaling the start of the green season.

                    <h3 class="title"> GREEN SEASON: LATE-NOVEMBER TO APRIL</h3>

                    <p class="text">  The green season is late November to April. The rainfall levels are highest between December to
                         February, so we do not recommend traveling during these months. However, the shoulder months of November,
                          March, and April are a beautiful time to visit Zimbabwe—and a great time to take advantage of lower-season 
                          discounts!

                        During this time, the landscape is lush and green, birds are in full migration, baby animals spring into life,
                         and the clouds create a dramatic sky, great for photography opportunities. Victoria Falls is at its fullest
                          at the end of the rainy season in April and May, but the falls are spectacular any time of year.</p>
